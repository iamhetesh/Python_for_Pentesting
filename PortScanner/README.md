#Port Scanner

This is a Python script that allows you to scan for open ports on a target IP address within a specified range of port numbers.

##Prerequisites

Python 3.x
socket module
requests module

Usage

Clone or download the repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the following command:

Copy code

```python port_scanner.py```

Follow the prompts and provide the required information:
```
Enter the target IP address.
Enter the starting port number.
Enter the last port number.
```
The script will initiate the port scanning process and display the results.

Description

The script performs the following steps:

Imports the necessary modules: sys, socket, os, time, and requests.

Defines a function generate_service_names() that generates a dictionary mapping port numbers to their corresponding service names.

Creates a constant variable SERVICE_NAMES by calling the generate_service_names() function.

Defines a function port_scanner(target, start_port, end_port) that takes a target IP address and a range of port numbers to scan.

Initializes an empty list open_ports to store the open ports.

Loops through each port number in the specified range and attempts to establish a TCP connection using socket module.

If the connection is successful (port is open), the port number is added to the open_ports list and a message is printed indicating that the port is open.

If the connection is unsuccessful (port is closed), a message is printed indicating that the port is closed.

Closes the socket connection and waits for a short period before moving to the next port.

Defines a function main() that serves as the entry point of the script.

Prompts the user to enter the target IP address, starting port number, and last port number.

Calls the port_scanner() function with the provided information.

Checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).

If the script is being run directly, calls the main() function to start the port scanning process.

Notes

The script uses the socket module to establish TCP connections and check for open ports.

The socket.setdefaulttimeout(1) line sets the timeout for connection attempts to 1 second.

The script utilizes the requests module to retrieve the service names associated with the open ports.

The service names are retrieved using the getservbyport() function from the socket module.

If an invalid target address is provided or if the user interrupts the scanning process, appropriate error messages are displayed.

After the scanning process is complete, a summary of the open ports is displayed, along with their corresponding service names (if available).

If no open ports are found, a message indicating so is displayed.

Feel free to modify and adapt the script according to your specific needs.
