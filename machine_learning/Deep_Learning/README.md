# Malware Detection and Classification using Deep Learning
This is a Python script that uses Flask to build a web application for detecting malware using a machine learning model. 
The script loads a dataset in CSV format, preprocesses it, and trains a deep neural network model using Keras. 
It uses LabelEncoder and StandardScaler from Scikit-learn to preprocess the data. 
It also uses EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to prevent overfitting during training. 
Once the model is trained, it evaluates the performance using confusion matrix and makes predictions on new data. 
Finally, it displays the results on the web interface using HTML templates.
