# Training the Deep Neural Network

Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is an effective approach for detecting malware. DNNs are able to learn complex patterns in malware behavior and can identify malicious files with high accuracy.

The process of training a DNN for malware detection typically involves several steps. First, a large dataset of malware and benign files is collected. This dataset is used to train the DNN by feeding it input data (i.e., the files) and their corresponding output labels (i.e., whether the file is malware or benign).

During training, the DNN adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the true labels. This is achieved through a process called backpropagation, where the error is propagated backwards through the network to adjust the weights and biases of the neurons. It is also important to continuously update the DNN with new malware samples as they emerge to ensure that it remains effective in detecting new threats.
