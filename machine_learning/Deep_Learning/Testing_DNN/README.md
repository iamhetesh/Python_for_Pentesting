# Testing the Pre-Trained DNN model

Testing the DNN with unknown samples for malware detection involves evaluating the model's performance on a dataset that was not used for training or validation. This process is commonly known as "testing on a holdout set." The unknown samples used for testing are typically collected from the wild, and their labels (i.e., whether they are malware or benign) are not disclosed to the model during the training phase.

To test the DNN with unknown samples, the DNN's best weights are used to classify the samples. These unknown samples can come from various sources, such as malware that has not been previously analyzed or malware that has been modified to evade detection. The DNN's accuracy in classifying these unknown samples is a crucial measure of its effectiveness in detecting new and unknown malware variants.

Overall, testing a DNN with unknown samples is an important step in evaluating its performance for malware detection. The ability to accurately classify unknown samples is a key factor in the effectiveness of a DNN for this task, and can help to identify new and emerging malware threats.
