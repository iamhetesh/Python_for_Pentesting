# Testing the Pre-Trained DNN model

Testing the DNN with unknown samples for malware detection involves evaluating the model's performance on a dataset that was not used for training or validation. This process is commonly known as "testing on a holdout set." The unknown samples used for testing are typically collected from the wild, and their labels (i.e., whether they are malware or benign) are not disclosed to the model during the training phase.

The testing phase serves as a way to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen samples. The performance metrics obtained during testing, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, provide insights into the model's ability to detect and classify malware correctly.

It is important to note that the testing phase is not a one-time process. As new types of malware emerge, the model must be updated and retested to ensure its continued effectiveness. Additionally, the testing process should be conducted using a representative sample of unknown malware to avoid bias and ensure the model's robustness.

In conclusion, testing the DNN with unknown samples is a crucial step in evaluating the effectiveness of a malware detection model. It provides insights into the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen samples and ensures its continued effectiveness as new types of malware emerge.
