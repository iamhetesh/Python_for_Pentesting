The server-side script sets up a socket connection on a specified IP address and port, listens for incoming connections, and waits for input from the connected client. The input received is sent to the client in the form of a JSON-encoded string, and the script continues to listen for further input until the connection is closed.

The client-side script establishes a socket connection with the server, and waits for commands to be received. Upon receiving a command, the script executes it in a shell, captures the output of the command, and sends the output back to the server in the form of a JSON-encoded string. The script continues to wait for commands until it receives the "q" command, which closes the connection.
